As Lead Bioinformatician & Data Scientist at [Jonah Ventures](https://jonahventures.com/), I leverage expertise in bioinformatics and cloud computing to process environmental DNA samples for a diverse range of clients including large commercial entities, academic and government organizations, and individual citizen scientists. I also collaborate with the Smithsonian and NOAA to develop highly scalable bioinformatics tools and infrastructure for DNA-based biodiversity data. As an Independent Consultant, I am conducting novel microbiome analyses for the University of Oregon and am helping the USGS design a conservation prioritization web tool.
 
While my recent endeavors focus heavily on computational biology, my foundational knowledge stems from extensive experience as a field biologist in Hawaii and an rich academic background in molecular biology and ecological theory. At my core is an insatiable curiosity and dedication to exploration and problem solving, whether diving into microbial ecosystems or pioneering bioinformatics innovations.
