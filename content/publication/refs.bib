abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological SocietyEricoid mycorrhiza occur only within the plant family Ericaceae, yet are globally widespread and contribute to carbon and nutrient cycling in many habitats where harsh conditions limit decomposition and plant nutrient uptake. An increasingly diverse range of fungi are recognized as ericoid symbionts and patterns in the distribution of ericoid taxa are beginning to emerge across scales. However, the true diversity of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi remains unresolved due to limited sampling from some regions and challenges associated with delineating mycorrhizal taxa from the broader fungal community associated with ericoid plants. Interpreting patterns in the diversity and distributions of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi will ultimately require improved understanding of their functional ecology and functional diversity, which is currently limited to a few well studied species. Fortunately, many ericoid taxa are amenable to experimental manipulation and continued ericoid mycorrhizal research promises to improve general understanding of the ecology and evolution of mycorrhizal symbioses.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS. Both top-down (grazing) and bottom-up (resource availability) forces can determine the strength of priority effects, or the effects of species arrival history on the structure and function of ecological communities, but their combined influences remain unresolved. To test for such influences, we assembled experimental communities of wood-decomposing fungi using a factorial manipulation of fungivore (Folsomia candida) presence, nitrogen availability, and fungal assembly history. We found interactive effects of all three factors on fungal species composition and wood decomposition 1 year after the fungi were introduced. The strength of priority effects on community structure was affected primarily by nitrogen availability, whereas the strength of priority effects on decomposition rate was interactively regulated by nitrogen and fungivores. These results demonstrate that top-down and bottom-up forces jointly determine how strongly assembly history affects community structure and function.},

@article{Barge2019,
abstract = {Aim: Foliar fungi – pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes – form taxonomically diverse communities that affect plant health and productivity. The composition of foliar fungal communities is variable at spatial scales both small (e.g. individual plants) and large (e.g. continents), yet few studies have attempted to tease apart spatial from climatic factors influencing these communities. Moreover, few studies have sampled in more than 1 year to gauge interannual variation in community structure. Location: The Pacific Northwest of western North America. Taxon: Foliar fungi associated with the deciduous tree Populus trichocarpa. Methods: In two consecutive years, we used DNA metabarcoding to characterize foliar fungal communities of Populus trichocarpa across its geographic range, which encompasses a sharp climatic transition as it crosses the Cascade Mountain Range. We used multivariate analyses to (a) test for and differentiate spatial and environmental factors affecting community composition and (b) test for temporal variation in community composition across spatial and environmental gradients. Results: In both study years, we found that foliar fungal community composition varied among sites and between regions (east vs. west of the Cascades). We found that climate explained more variation in community composition than geographic distance, although the majority of variation explained by each was shared. We also found that interannual variation in community composition depended on environmental context: communities located in the dry, eastern portion of the tree's geographic range varied more between study years than those located in the wet, western portion of the tree's range. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the environment plays a greater role in structuring foliar fungal communities than dispersal limitation.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation resulting in habitat loss and increased isolation is a dominant driver of global species declines. Habitat isolation and connectivity vary across scales, and understanding how connectivity affects biodiversity can be challenging because the relevant scale depends on the taxa involved. A multiscale analysis can provide insight in biodiversity patterns across spatial scale when information on dispersal ability is not available, in particular for community-level studies focusing on multiple taxa. In this study, we examine the relationship between arthropod diversity, patch area, and connectivity using a multiscale approach. We make use of a natural experiment on Hawai‘i Island, where historic volcanic activity has transformed contiguous native forests to lava matrix and discrete forest patches. This landscape of patches has persisted for 150 yr, and we selected 10,000 ha consisting of 863 patches to analyze landscape connectivity using a graph theory approach. We collected arthropod samples from Metrosideros polymorpha tree canopies in 34 forest patches during multiple years. We analyzed the relationship of arthropod diversity with area, as well as with connectivity across increasing scales, or dispersal threshold distances. In contrast to well-established ecological theory as well as prior work on birds and fungi in this system, we did not find support for a canonical species–area relationship. Next, we calculated connectivity across spatial scales and found lower Shannon diversity with higher connectivity at small scales, but no effect at increased dispersal threshold distances. We examined the landscape structure and found all habitat patches connected into three subnetworks at a 350 m threshold distance. All patches were connected at 700 m threshold distance, indicating structural dispersal limitation only at small scales. Our findings suggest that canopy arthropods are not dispersal limited at scales shown to impact both soil fungi and birds in this system. Instead, Hawaiian canopy arthropods may perceive the landscape as a connected area where discrete forest patches and the early-successional matrix contribute resources that vary spatially with regard to habitat quality. We argue for the utility of multiscale approaches, and the importance of examining maintenance of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes that persist for hundreds of years.},

@article{Brandt2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Journal of Ecology {\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological SocietyThe ecological conditions promoting evolutionary priority effects, where the order and timing of ancestral species arrival into a new habitat influences extant community assembly, are poorly understood. Studies in the New Zealand alpine indicated that early-arriving angiosperm lineages dominated communities via niche pre-emption. Forests have a much longer (>60 myr) evolutionary history in New Zealand than alpine communities (<2 myr) and greater structural complexity. Here we ask whether community effects of arrival order persist in cool temperate forest communities in southern New Zealand that have assembled throughout the Cenozoic. Combining phylogenetically derived clade ages and forest vegetation data from across a mountain range, we compare effects of clade age on relative richness and abundance of two taxonomic groups (pteridophytes and angiosperms) along precipitation gradients. We show that older clades of both groups tended to have greater relative abundance and older angiosperm clades had greater relative richness. Relative richness and abundance also increased with regional clade diversity, independent of clade age. The strength of the clade age effect on community dominance changed differently along precipitation gradients depending on the response and taxonomic group. Clade age had a stronger effect on relative abundance of pteridophytes with increasing elevation and westerliness (i.e. as precipitation increased). In contrast, the effect of clade age on relative abundance of angiosperms decreased with westerliness. Precipitation did not alter the clade age effect on relative richness. Synthesis. We show that evolutionary priority effects persist in communities with a longer evolutionary history than has been investigated to date and across physiologically contrasting taxonomic groups, suggesting priority effects are general drivers of community assembly over macro-evolutionary time-scales. Furthermore, the strength of evolutionary priority effects attenuated along a gradient of decreasing resources, at least for pteridophytes, which improves our ability to predict conditions in which the arrival order of lineages influences community assembly.},
